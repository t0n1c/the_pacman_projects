# the_pacman_projects
This is a project for educational purposes proposed by the AI deparment of the university of Berkeley (http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html). The aim is to learn some of the bases of AI and it was developed to the UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence course, CS 188. The codebase is given and by way of fill-the-gaps exercises you need to complete every single mini-project. The given code is not pythonic and not PEP8 compliant at all, a minimal improvement has been performed but it is not the main aim of this project. The sourcetree has been refactored so that different mini-projects share the same codebase. It is written in Python3.4 although originally the codebase was written in Python2.7 so it has been ported.
